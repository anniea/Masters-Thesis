%The area of face recognition research continues to push boundaries, but still face difficulties with recognition in unconstrained environments. Obstacles like image quality, pose, illumination, and expressions present many challenges. The application of convolutional neural networks, and their extraordinary ability to learn complex features provide an opportunity to create face recognition systems that excel in this area. However, these networks are hard to make sense of without proper visualization. This report presents a tool to continuously display data produced during network training using established visualization techniques. In the future, we aim to suggest a method for improving such systems by utilizing the predictability of facial expressions in experimental networks. To that end, the report provides research performed on the state of the art, visualization techniques, datasets, and deep learning libraries.
