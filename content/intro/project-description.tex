\noindent This Master's thesis will focus on improving upon an interface for visualizing data produced by an artificial neural network during training. An initial version of this interface has been completed as part of the Fall project. The interface allows a user to upload and run a program that trains a network, and visualizes the data created by the program using various visualization techniques. The resulting interface and its visualizations will be presented using well-known example networks for image recognition. \\

\noindent Also included in the thesis is a case study on the application of artificial neural networks in face recognition systems. Many networks struggle with overcoming the challenge of facial expressions, since the features of a face vary greatly with the expression it portrays. This thesis propose to exploit face expression data and explore how it can be utilized to improve a face recognition system.
