% from contributions:
% The thesis introduces a visualization tool, implemented as a web interface, that can help researchers gain a better understanding of the behaviour of their ANNs and how to improve them. The effort will be concentrated on generating visualizations for networks whose input data reside in the image domain. The tool should be easily extensible, in regard to adding new visualization techniques and customizing the tool to a different machine learning framework. \\

% The thesis also explores the face recognition field by investigating if the exploitation of facial expression data in face recognition systems could be beneficial. The results of the case study will indicate whether the approach has initial merit and should be researched further.

% RQ og RO for case:
% RQ 2: How can facial expression data be utilized to improve a face recognition system?
% RO 2.1:Investigate what happens when incorporating expression data in a face recognition system.

For the case study, we were interested in
