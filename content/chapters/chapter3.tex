\section{Visualization Tool}

This section will present existing visualization tools for ANNs. We will describe their advantageous features, what limits their use, and end the section with a comparison where we try to uncover the gap.

\subsection{Description of Existing Visualization Tools}

The following are the most prominent visualization applications for ANNs. Other alternatives were found to be either too specific in what they provide, or not even in a working state of implementation. The three tools are very different in terms of functionality and the frameworks they support, but their main purpose is still the same: to aid in the creation and understanding of an artificial neural network.

\subsubsection{TensorBoard}

TensorBoard is a suite of visualization tools for TensorFlow programs. The purpose of TensorBoard is to make it easier to understand, debug, and optimize artificial neural networks. It can be used to visualize TensorFlow graphs, which is TensorFlow's way of representing computations. It can also be used to plot network metrics, such as how the learning rate varies over time, or how the loss function is changing. This is done by annotating the nodes of the graph with so called summary operations, that writes summary data to a log. TensorBoard then reads this log, in order to generate real-time visualizations. The visualizations are mostly restricted to plots, histograms and visualizations of the network architecture. However, it can also visualize high-dimensional data like embeddings, with a very interactive user interface. Functionality for writing to the TensorBoard log is also included in Keras, but only for the basic visualizations, and with limited customizability.

\subsubsection{DIGITS}

The NVIDIA Deep Learning GPU Training System, also called DIGITS, is a web application developed for managing deep artificial neural networks created in Caffe, one of the leading programming frameworks for deep learning. A drawback of Caffe is that you need to construct the network architecture of a in plain text configuration files, which can be tedious, especially for large networks. DIGITS provides Caffe users with an intuitive interface for doing many of the cumbersome tasks that usually requires manipulating the configuration files. At a later point, support for the scientific computing framework Torch was also added. The application allows user to upload and manage both datasets and models, and also makes pre-trained models such as AlexNet and GoogLeNet available for use. DIGITS allows user to schedule, monitor, and manage training jobs, as well as analyzing accuracy and loss in real time. In addition, DIGITS allows you to classify images using the fully trained networks, providing simple visualizations of the weights and activations for each layer of the result. \\

\noindent It is worth noting that DIGITS has been developed simultaneously to our visualization tool, and its current version is a significant upgrade from the version available when we first started our Specialization Project. DIGITS was an inspirational source to the problem statement, due to it only supporting the use of Caffe and Torch. The developers of DIGITS have previously stated that they are not planning on adding any more frameworks, and as late as April confirmed that they will not support TensorFlow. However, recently they announced on their website that they will be releasing DIGITS with TensorFlow support in July.

\subsubsection{Deep Visualization Toolbox}

The Deep Visualization Toolbox \cite{yosinski-deepvis} is a software tool that provides an interactive visualization of a trained artificial convolutional neural network as the network responds to user-provided input, either an uploaded image or video from a live webcam feed. The toolbox is developed for networks created in Caffe. It comes with a default network, but also includes the possibility of adapting your own networks. Users can view the filters of a selected layer, either as actual activations or as images synthesized to produce high activations through deep visualization. A specific neuron can be selected to explore further. This will show deep visualizations, the top nine images from the training set that activates the filter the most, and the pixels from those images most responsible for the high activations, computed via the deconvolution technique. Note that these last three visualizations are pre computed instead of computed in real time, since they are far too expensive to run live.

\subsection{Comparison of the Visualization Tools}

Looking away from the obvious difference in the frameworks they support, we start with comparing them in terms of functionality. \\

\noindent As previously stated, all of the three visualization tools aim to facilitate the process of dealing with artificial neural networks, some of them to a greater extent than others. The Deep Visualization Toolbox only takes fully trained networks, and thus it rather focuses on the general knowledge learned from such networks instead of assisting in the training process. Both TensorBoard and DIGITS are intended to run while training, and DIGITS even goes as far as managing the whole creation and training process. We believe the management of the training process is an invaluable feature, and thus plan to incorporate this in our own visualization tool.\\

\noindent Another distinction between the tools is that they employ various complexity of visualization techniques. TensorBoard focuses heavily on plotting graphs and histograms, while the Deep Visualization Toolbox presents significantly more advanced techniques such as deconvolution and deep visualization. DIGITS provides the very basics, which is plots of the loss and accuracy while training, and visualizations of layer activations and weights when classifying. Of course the basic visualizations for training also needs to be available in our tool, but we intend to go even further and include the advanced visualization techniques from the Deep Visualization Toolbox as well. \\

\noindent Even though the described visualization tools combined covers a large area of the desired functionality, the problem is that they do not support a number of machine learning frameworks. Only TensorBoard provides some support for Keras, which is our framework of choice for working with artificial neural networks. TensorBoard does not offer any advanced visualization techniques, neither does it help you remarkably in managing your networks. It has been expressed a need for a tool similar to the Deep Visualization Toolbox for TensorFlow on the TensorFlow github, and thus we have solid reason to believe that there is a need to make advanced visualization techniques more easily available for Keras as well. We aspire to bridge the gap between the existing visualization tools in terms of functionality, and to improve the insufficient selection of visualization tools for those using Keras.

Things that could be added:
- tensorboard and digits are still being worked on. deepvis not so much
- keyword is live / real-time
