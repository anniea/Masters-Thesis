\subsection{TensorBoard}

Can create graphs, and view the structure of the network, histograms, 

\subsection{DIGITS}

DIGITS is a web application for training deep learning models created in Caffe, one of the leading libraries regarding convolutional neural networks. The drawback of Caffe is that you need to construct the architecture in plain text configuration files, which can be very tedious, especially for big networks. DIGITS provides Caffe users with an intuitive interface for doing many of the cumbersome tasks that usually requires manipulating the configuration files. In addition, DIGITS generate graphs, statistics and visualization of your network as it is training.
