\subsection{The MNIST Network}


\subsubsection{Training Progress}

\subsubsection{Layer Activations}

\begin{comment}
FIG. 1.5:
- We see that the first convolutional layer do not find any specific features
- It is not until the second convolutional layer that we see features in terms of edges.
- Fc 3: the network is 100\% certain that it is class 0.

FIG. 1.6:
- Shows conv2 at 0, 5 and 10. Should have 1 as well.
