%===================================== CHAP 2 =================================

\chapter{Background Theory}

\section{Artificial Neural Networks}

\textit{This was missing in the specialization project. Need to cover all concepts used later in the report. This includes all different layers of a neural network. The layers (dropout, pooling, etc) could perhaps be a separate section after this one.}

\section{Convolutional Networks}

\textit{More in-depth than covered in the specialization project. \\
What exactly is the convolutional operation? Convolutional layer (local connections and weight sharing) vs normal layer.}

\section{Residual Networks}

\section{Face Recognition}

\textit{Can probably use a lot from the specialization project here.}

\section{Facial Expression}

\textit{Here as well.}

\section{Visualization}

\textit{Describe all the different techniques, perhaps in more detail. \\
Possibly even implementation level.}
