%===================================== CHAP 2 =================================

\chapter{Background Theory}

\section{Neural Networks}

This was missing in the specialization project. Need to cover all concepts used later in the report. This includes all different layers of a neural network. The layers (dropout, pooling, etc) could perhaps be a separate section after this one.

\section{Convolutional Networks}

More in-depth than covered in the specialization project. 
What exactly is the convolutional operation? Convolutional layer vs normal layer.

\section{Face Recognition}

Can probably use a lot from the specialization project here.

\section{Facial Expression}

Here as well.

\section{Visualization}

Describe all the different techniques, perhaps in more detail.
Possibly even implementation level.
